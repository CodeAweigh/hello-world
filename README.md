# hello-world

Ok, here we go!

A journey commences today in to the (for me) recently discovered wonderful world of C#. My mission is to get as up to speed with the C# language as possible in the next 6 months and, ultimately, to obtain gainful employment in this area. 

I need to find a suitable project to follow and contribute to which will help my learning process and bridge the gap between my knowledge and the minimum requirement for employment.

I want to explore and develop the following areas (although not necessarily all on GitHub) Version Control, Unit Testing, C# language, Agile Software Development Practices.

Wishing me loads of luck,

Declan (CodeAweigh).
